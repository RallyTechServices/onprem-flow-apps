#Project Growth

Uses workspace revision history to show the project growth over the selected time period.

If no workspaces are selected, the project growth for the current workspace is calculated.  Multiple workspaces
may be selected via the workspace picker.  Note that performance may degrade as more workspaces are selected.

Closed projects are included in the total.

This app does NOT use the LBAPI so it may work with on-premise versions of Rally.
